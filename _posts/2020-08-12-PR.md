# 1. What is Page Rank?

**PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used to calculate the weight for web pages.**

# 2. PR Equation

$$S(V_i) = (1-d) + d * \sum_{j\in In(v_i)}\frac{1}{|Out(v_j)|}S(V_j)$$

- Denotes
    - $S(V_i)$ ← the weight of webpage $i$
    - $d$ ← damping factor, in case of no outgoing links
    - $In(v_i)$ ← inbound links of $i$, which is a set.
    - $Out(v_j)$ ← outgoing links of $j$, which is a set.
    - $|Out(v_j)|$ ← the number of outbound links

# 2.1. Example

Weight of node $e$ is below as:

$$In(v_e) = [a, b], j\in [a, b] \\
S(V_e) = (1-d) + d*(S(V_a) + \frac{1}{2}S(V_b))$$

**In the initialization, the weight of each node is $1$.**
