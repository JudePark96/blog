# Ambiguity In Sentence Structure

### 1. Attachment ambiguity

A sentence has an attachment ambiguity if a particular constituent can be attached to the parse tree at more than one place.

### 2. Coordination ambiguity

In coordination ambiguity different sets of phrases can be conjoined by a con- junction like *and*. For example, the phrase ***old men and women*** can be bracketed as *[old [men and women]]*, referring to ***old men*** and ***old women***, or as ***[old men] and [women]*,** in which case it is only the men who are old.
