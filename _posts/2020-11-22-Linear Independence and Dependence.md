# Linear Independence and Dependence

If $S = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_r}$ is a nonempty set of vectors in a vector space $V$, then the vector equation:
$$
k_1v_1 + k_2v_2+ ... + k_rv_r = 0
$$
has at least one solution, namely,
$$
k_1=0, k_2=0, ..., k_r =0
$$
We call this the trivial solution. If this is the only solution, then $S$ is said to be a **linearly independent set**. if there are solutions in addition to the trivial solution then S is said to be a **Linearly dependent set**
