Hi, I'm a student in the Department of Computer Science at Kookmin University.

I've received the certification of SW Maestro 6th mentee from the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, South Korea.
Also I'm expected to graduate Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Kookmin University in Feb 2021.
